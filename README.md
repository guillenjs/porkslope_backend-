# Porkslope API

This is a Rails API for the application [Porkslope](https://github.com/guillenjs/porkslope). Porkslope is an application for shoppers to be able to create grocery list by categories. The grocery lists can be created with the inventory that currently exist in the store so that shoppers don't accidently add items that are currently not stocked. A shopper can view their updated cart price and once they have shopped they can save it and create a history of their expenses.
